						<p id="weFew">This help center is for a special kind of people, those who are aware of the urgency of changing our personal daily habits in light of worldwide trends. King Henry in his St. Crispen's Day Speech, (William Shakespeare, 1599) refers to his soldiers as "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."  Here at this CCBS center we will refer to the "we happy few" as those of us who are especially concerned about the world trends and how we can take personal action with respect to them.  Our focus is upon the excessive consumption of natural resources, pollution of the environment, warfare happening due to dwindling energy resources, and further evolution of personal and social practices that cannot be sustained by available natural resources and ecology.  We happy few are those who are less committed to the control exerted by the agencies of capital accumulation, consumerism, government, and religion.  We are less committed to agencies within our culture that are concerned primarily with the present rather than the future.  Therefore, we happy few are freer to respond to the advice of science about what is likely to happen.</p>

						<p id="weFew">But the predictions of scientists can have little effect without our help. That help is our acts of <span style="font-weight:bold">mediation</span>, in other words, the management of current daily behavior on behalf of generations that will follow us. However, this help center will not propose political agendas or political solutions. In contrast, it will advocate that intercession into the lives of others is best accomplished by <span style="font-weight:bold">setting good personal examples</span> that might exploit any tendency of others imitate us.  </p>

						<p id="weFew">This CCBS center if for those willing to curtail our personal behavior patterns that do not promote survival of a livable world.  Fortunately, the curtailment of consumption does not necessarily mean curtailment of happiness.   A high standard of living does not necessary mean a high standard of consumption.    Indeed, links at this help center will connect with ways if increasing personal happiness as we convert to lifestyles that are far less consuming and are sustainable. </p>
